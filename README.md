Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions/
Methane is a primary component of natural gas and is burned to ptoducce other gas components such as Hydrogen, carbon black and Carbon monoxide. 

Cleaning the data with Excel: 
1. I renamed the dataset heading to a title that suits the data contained in it (Methane Emissioons).
2. Froze, and Bolded the first row in the dataset that represents the column names.
3. Deeleted the first column with numerial numbers of the countries since Excel automatically names the rows with numbers.
4. Manually spaced the rows so get a better view of the data contained in them.
