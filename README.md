# Global-Methane-Emissions 2019 - 2022.
This an analysis on the Global Methane emissions Dataset provided in Kaggle using Excel. 

Description of the data: 
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions/
Methane is a primary component of natural gas and is burned to ptoducce other gas components such as Hydrogen, carbon black and Carbon monoxide. The Emissions in the dataset are recorded in Kilo tonnes (kt). 

Making effective adjustments in the data with Excel: 
1. I renamed the dataset heading to a title that suits the data contained in it (Methane Emissioons).
2. Froze, and Bolded the first row in the dataset that represents the column names.
3. Deeleted the first column with numerial numbers of the countries since Excel automatically names the rows with numbers.
4. Manually spaced the rows so get a better view of the data contained in them.

Working with the dataset: 
I managed to generate insights from the data using Excel. This included 
1. The Continent with the highest Emissions
2. Country around the world with the highest emissions
3. The Country in Africa with the highest emissions
4. The Type of emissions that are highest in both Countries (Energy, Agriculture, Waste, and others)
5. The type of Energy Emissions (in this case Segment) that are highest in both Countries
6. And te reasons for Emissions (Flared, Vented, and Fugitive).

Insights from the Dataset:
1. The total Global Emissions Continent	Sum of Emissions ![Screenshot (559)](https://github.com/zilphar/Global-Methane-Emissions/assets/116642579/d26f55a7-2552-4a13-980f-d24c9ae8c3c2) 

2. The Asian Pacific has the highest amount of Methane Emissions so I dived into that to determine why. 
   China had the leading amount of Emissions with 30303.92 kt between 2019 -2021 and 50144.44 kt in 2022 a 67% increase in the amount of emissions.

3. Diving into China with the leading Emissions, I found that Energy Emissions are the highest in China followed by Agricultural Emissions.
   This is what i concluded from the above China Emissions:

China is known for highly relying on Coal for energy. This results in burning fossil fuels for electricity, industrial processes and transposrtation. Cola is  a carbon intensive fuel and its combustion releases large amounts of Carbon fioxide into the atmosphere hence the high amount of emissions from steam coal (14809 kt).
Also the rapid Indutsrialization and economic growth have led to icreased energy consupmtion often met by coal fixed power plants, meaning the industrila sector is a major contributor to energy related emissions. 

4. Reasons for Emissions:
   Vented among the three types of Emissions has the highest amount of Emissions.
   Vented is the release of gases directly into the atmosphere in small amounts. The reasons why high amounts are released through it is because
