# Global-Methane-Emissions
This an analysis on the Global Methane emissions Dataset provided in Kaggle using Excel. 

Description of the data: 
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions/
Methane is a primary component of natural gas and is burned to ptoducce other gas components such as Hydrogen, carbon black and Carbon monoxide. The Emissions in the dataset are recorded in Kilo tonnes (kt). 

Making effective adjustments in the data with Excel: 
1. I renamed the dataset heading to a title that suits the data contained in it (Methane Emissioons).
2. Froze, and Bolded the first row in the dataset that represents the column names.
3. Deeleted the first column with numerial numbers of the countries since Excel automatically names the rows with numbers.
4. Manually spaced the rows so get a better view of the data contained in them.

Working with the dataset: 
I managed to generate insights from the data using Excel. This included 
1. The Continent with the highest Emissions
2. Country around the world with the highest emissions
3. The Country in Africa with the highest emissions
4. The Type of emissions that are highest in both Countries (Energy, Agriculture, Waste, and others)
5. The type of Energy Emissions (in this case Segment) that are highest in both Countries
6. And te reasons for Emissions (Flared, Vented, and Fugitive).

Insights from the Dataset:
1. The total Global Emissions Continent	Sum of Emissions ![Screenshot (559)](https://github.com/zilphar/Global-Methane-Emissions/assets/116642579/fd8a3f00-bab6-4a6d-8913-f8f144981389)
